This is an openGL project in Visual Studio Code mostly incorporating resources available from https://github.com/VictorGordan/opengl-tutorials/tree/main. Currently on step 12
TODO LIST:
- Explaining steps on how to make this project run
- Creating a model loader using Assimp instead of building one from scratch like in the tutorial
- Actually finish this project xd
